## Forker's short intro: 
Purposes:
    1) Many of the LLM available to the *oobabooga's textgen-webui* do not do very well at writing text that SD models 'understand'.
I propose a simple solution: Simply filter the text response after it is generated; remove common conversational words and feed that resultant string to the sd-engine. It is better at prompting sd now than I am myself. 
    2) A solution to the many tokens taken up by images being represented in the chat history is to link to the resulting images; it is not ideal. (Maybe having the images show up in a pane parallel to the main chat pane would be ideal; the secondary pane could also access the chat-history and simply filter for the links and display the images.)
    3) I suggest different default settings that I believe might have wide appeal; but really I think support for adjusting and saving default settings should be possible directly from the browser.
    
    My suggestions will be up soon, I just need to remove some fluff. 

## Description:
TL;DR: Lets the bot answer you with a picture!  

Stable Diffusion API pictures for TextGen, v.1.1.0  
An extension to [oobabooga's textgen-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) allowing you to receive pics generated by [Automatic1111's SD-WebUI API](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)

</details>

Load it in the `--chat` or `--cai-chat` mode with `--extension sd_api_pictures` alongside `send_pictures` (it's not really required, but completes the picture, *pun intended*).  

The image generation is triggered either:  
- manually through the 'Force the picture response' button while in Manual or Interactive modes OR  
- automatically in Immersive/Interactive mode if the words `'send|main|message|me'` are followed by `'image|pic|picture|photo|snap|snapshot|selfie|meme'` in the user's prompt  
- always on in Picturebook/Adventure mode (if not currently suppressed by 'Suppress the picture response')  

## Prerequisits

One needs an available instance of Automatic1111's webui running with an `--api` flag. Ain't tested with a notebook / cloud hosted one but should be possible.   
To run it locally in parallel on the same machine, specify custom `--listen-port` for either Auto1111's or ooba's webUIs.  

## Features:
- API detection (press enter in the API box)  
- VRAM management (model shuffling)  
- Three different operation modes (manual, interactive, always-on)  
- persistent settings via settings.json

The model input is modified only in the interactive mode; other two are unaffected. The output pic description is presented differently for Picture-book / Adventure mode.

### Persistents settings

Create or modify the `settings.json` in the `text-generation-webui` root directory to override the defaults
present in script.py, ex:

```json
{
    "sd_api_pictures-manage_VRAM": 1,
    "sd_api_pictures-save_img": 1,
    "sd_api_pictures-prompt_prefix": "(Masterpiece:1.1), detailed, intricate, colorful, (solo:1.1)",
    "sd_api_pictures-sampler_name": "DPM++ 2M Karras"
}
```

will automatically set the `Manage VRAM` & `Keep original images` checkboxes and change the texts in `Prompt Prefix` and `Sampler name` on load.

## Demonstrations:

Those are examples of the version 1.0.0, but the core functionality is still the same
